Tv script generation by using RNN

In this project the aim was generation tv scripts by using RNN and LSTM typed Neural Networks.

Since the output depends the current state and the previous states LSTM and RNN typed Neural Networks are used.

The model has designed to take lists which contains ten words inside and generate outputs according to them.

Deeper LSTM typed models could increase the accuracy.
